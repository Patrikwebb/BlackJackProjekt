	<h1>Black Jack Rules:</h1>
		<p>
			Black Jack is a game in which the player does not play against other players,
			but only against a dealer.
			The purpose of the game is to get a higher hand than the dealer
			but not more than 21 (then the player loses).
			In Black Jack jargon the player becomes "fat".<Br />
			<Br />
			Each player has got several choices to make each round.<Br />
			<Br />
		</p>
	
	<h3>HIT</h3>
		<p>
			Player choose to draw one more card.<Br />
	 		<Br />
	 	</p>
	 	
	<h3>STAY</h3>
	 	<p>	
	 		Player choose to stop (i.e to cease drawing new cards).<Br />
	 		<Br />
		</p>
		
	<h3>SPLIT</h3>
		<p>
	  		Players choose to split his hand, this
			is only possible if the player has duplicates.<Br />
	 		<Br />
	 	</p>	

	<h3>DOUBLE</h3>
		<p>
	  		Player choose to double his bet and draws a final card.<Br />
	 		<Br />
	 	</p>
	 	
	<h3>INSURANCE</h3>	
		<p>
	  		Player choose to insure his wager which costs half of his bet,
			if the player wins he recieves his bet back but the dealer takes his insurence.
			If the dealer wins the player gets his insurance x2.
			This can only be done if the dealer has got an ace as first card.<Br />
